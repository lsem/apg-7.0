/**
 * \page utils Utilities
 * The APG [library](\ref library)
 * is designed for minimum footprint with no I/O and the ability to exclude unneeded pieces of code
 * through configuration in \ref apg.h.
 * However, for a desktop application visuals are usually required and many of the utilities here are simply
 * pretty printers of APG structures and results.
 *
 * For a full list and descriptions of utility functions see utilities.h & utilities.c.
 *
 * Additionally, there are a number of more complex facilities that are used in two or more places in APG
 * and may be of use in user applications as well.
 * These are all implemented as classes, each with its own constructor and destructor.
 *
 * ### Data Conversions - Encoding and Decoding
 * conv.h & conv.c <br>
 * Many applications require data format conversions on the fly.
 * This data conversion object provides conversions to and from Latin1 (ISO-8859-1), UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
 * Base64 decoding and encoding can be added as a prefix or postfix operation for any of these formats.
 *
 * ### Display Data in hexdump Style Format
 * format.h & format.c <br>
 * APG phrases are often not printable as ASCII characters. This utility object
 * will display arbitrary 8-bit bytes and 32-bit Unicode characters in hexdump-style formats.
 * For 8-bit byte data, this is similar to the Linux command
 * [`hexdump`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hexdump.1.html).
 * For 32-bit word data, similar formatting is provided.

 * ### Line Handling for ASCII Data
 * lines.h & lines.c <br>
 * Often it is convenient to parse ASCII data into lines and to be able to
 * easily iterate through the lines and/or normalize the line endings.
 * The `lines` object provides such a parser.

 * ### Line Handling for Unicode Data
 * linesu.h & linesu.c <br>
 * Often it is convenient to parse Unicode data into lines and to be able to
 * easily iterate through the lines and/or normalize the line endings.
 * The `linesu` object provides such a parser.

 * ### Message Log
 * msglog.h & msglog.c <br>
 * Often an application will need to collect error or warning messages for display at the end,
 * rather that stopping on each error or warning. The `msglog` object provides a consistent
 * and reusable means of doing this throughout APG and any other application that has a need for it.
